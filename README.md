# 👋 Welcome, I’m Jose Ivan Hernandez

This isn’t just a GitHub profile.  
It’s a system of **healing, building, and contributing**—through code, through resilience, through shared experience.

## 🧠 About This Portfolio

Here you’ll find projects built across environments I didn’t own—public libraries, lab computers, free software. That’s why everything here is:

- 📂 Structured for **portability**
- 🌐 Built with **variable hardware, software, and networking** in mind
- 🔄 Designed to run where others assume it can’t

I’m a **student, system builder, and social engineer**. Whether it’s automation, AI, or CLI work, I build not for luxury, but for **equity**.

## 🌍 Repository Uplift Philosophy

Not every project here began with me. Some were started by others and left behind. But I believe:

> **No repo left behind.**

When I fork a project, I don’t just clone it — I adapt it with intent:

- ✅ All original authors are credited
- 🔁 Pull requests are offered when improvements are made
- 📈 Underrepresented projects are elevated through visibility

**Forking is building bridges**, not just borrowing bricks.

## 🎯 What I’m Focused On Now

- Building an AI voice system that tells stories with empathy  
- Syncing and automating my life across public systems  
- Creating reproducible frameworks for under-resourced students  
- Integrating trauma-informed logic into cloud computing
